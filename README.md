This project uses a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset contains sonar signal readings collected by bouncing sonar waves off different objects. The objective is to predict whether the object is a rock or a mine based on the given data. The Logistic Regression algorithm is employed for binary classification.
